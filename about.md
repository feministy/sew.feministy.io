ðŸ‘‹ hello, I'm Liz.

I sew lots of garments for myself, and not really anything for anyone else. Except for babies, they're cute and small.

I'm a software engineer by day and I live in the pacific northwest, where it is basically always raining. You can ðŸ‘€ find me on instagram ðŸ“¸ as [liz.crafty](https://www.instagram.com/liz.crafty/).
